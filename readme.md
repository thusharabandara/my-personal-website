## My Personal Website

I am using my knowledge of web development to develop my own website with the help of the following web technologies and services.<br>

Also, I am really happy to say that all the work I have been doing on this website is purely my work.

### Developed using:

[HTML5](https://whatwg.org/)<br>
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/)<br>
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)<br>
[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)<br>
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)<br>
[XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/) to store all the information about my interests including Books I have read, TV Shows, Movies, and Music<br>
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the site<br>
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control for source control<br>
Everytime my favourite code editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<br>
